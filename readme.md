# Data Analysis with the Pandas Python Library
## Working Directory
The working directory for the python code is within the `PyCitySchools` folder.

## Analysis Location
Analysis writeup is available in the first markup Cell in `PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb`

## Credit and Comments
There was code pulled from a starter Jupyter notebook provided by the Data Analytics course this project was done for, but I have not included the starter file itself in this repository.

Aside from basic syntax queries and the provided code for specific equations, the code here is my own work (following the prompts and rubric) unless otherwise indicated in the `PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb` comments. Some features may not have been necessary (adding "school_name" indices to all of the Series objects), but they helped uncover some bad logic at early stages in the debugging/verification process, and have been left in (often commented out) for ease of auditing the code as needed.
